### where-was-i

##### What does this do?

This script saves your last used directory upon closing a shell and prompts whether you want to return upon opening a new shell.

### Installation

Put the .sh file into your home directory.

Add "source ~/where-was-i.sh" to the end of your .bashrc file. 

Done


Use with caution, as this is probably not secure (someone could load malicous code into the last_dir file for example)
